These confidence intervals were obtained from 10,000 runs. Pre-treatment sequencing data was used for running PhylogicNDT (which was run with Cluster + BuildTree). Timepoints were also included in the .sif files. Observed gamma values were obtained by counting all mutations with frequencing between [f1,f2] = [.01,.2] (discounting mutations with 2 or fewer mutant reads). Mutations were allowed to be double counted towards both m and gamma.
